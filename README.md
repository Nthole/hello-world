# hello-world
My first repository on GitHub. "This is an introduction to my data science training to see what information i can add
I am based in South Afica, this data science course is challenging but very useful to me.
I always wonder if it is not good to learn something bad or something good for the sake of knowledge.
My strong points are: Reading: Knew ideas:, Mapping:, and Finding new information through ideas and data.
Even thou i wonder what is this excersice about, i know that the first training and lessson doesnt make sense
When we learn somethig, it is our wish to see what is happening, thats my motto in life.
